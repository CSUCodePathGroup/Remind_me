## Overview

### Description

Prompts the user to enter a task or a chore along with the date and time that they want to be reminded of that chore. Then, when the date and time is satisfied, the app will send a pop up notification or an alarm, in case the user forgot the chore that was entered. 

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity/ Education
- **Mobile:** This application would be developed for mobile devices since it will be sending an alarm or notification to the user when a reminder pops up. Those characteristics are not typical on other non-mobile devices. In other words, mobile devices like cell phones are used by people 80% of the time, which will boost the efficiency of the app becuase a user will actually know that they have a reminder.
- **Story:** User can enter a reminder and a time and date associated with it, then an alarm will pop up to notify the user. The reminder will automatically be deleted from a list of other reminders. A user can also hold on a reminder to manully remove it.
- **Market:** Any individual can utilize this application.
- **Habit:** The average person will always have some form of task or chore to accomplish in the near future, which means that a user will be using this app depending on how busy they are. 
- **Scope:** The application can be seen as a simple reminder app at first, then it can possibly evolve, with additional UI changes and some expansions, into an app that can be seen as mandatory and efficient as an ordinary clock alarm that 95% of people use to wake up in the morning for work or class.
